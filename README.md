## üîß **INSTANT SETUP (2 MINUTES)**

```bash
# 1. Clone & Install (30 seconds)
git clone https://github.com/SINGHBP29/HackForge/edit/main/
pip install fastmcp ollama sqlite3

# 2. Run for Puch AI (30 seconds)

## üö® **PROBLEM: Current MCP Systems Miss Critical Cases**

### ‚ùå **What Existing Systems DON'T Do:**
- Miss suicide ideation in conversations
- No real-time crisis intervention  
- No music/video therapy recommendations
- Forget previous conversations
- Generic responses without personalization

### ‚úÖ **Our SOLUTION:**
```python
# INSTANT CRISIS DETECTION
crisis_patterns = {
    'immediate_danger': ['kill myself', 'end my life', 'suicide'],
    'self_harm': ['hurt myself', 'cut myself', 'razor', 'pills'], 
    'despair': ['hopeless', 'no point', 'give up', 'worthless']
}

# MOOD-BASED CONTENT DELIVERY  
if mood == "anxious":
    return {
        "music": "https://youtube.com/calm-music-playlist",
        "video": "https://youtube.com/breathing-exercises", 
        "meditation": "https://headspace.com/anxiety-relief"
    }
```
